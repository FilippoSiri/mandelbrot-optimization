# Optimized Mandelbrot set generation

University project that aims to implement and evaluate optimized Mandelbrot set algorithm using:
  - NVIDIA CUDA
  - Parallelization with OpenMP
  - Hand-vectorization with Intel x86 intrinsic
    
## Setup
We ran our implementation on a 12th Gen Intel Core i9-12900K CPU with 24 threads and an NVIDIA T400 GPU

## Report
We wrote a [report](report.pdf) on how we implemented the various versions of the algorithm, optimized and improved it, and some metrics and statistics about the execution time.
